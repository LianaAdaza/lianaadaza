					I'm Liana Adaza, an incoming freshman pursuing a B.S. in Computer Engineering at Florida International University. <br>
					As a person who is constantly excited to learn and combine new technical skills with creativity, I actively seek to participate in activities that are relevant to my field of interest. My strong passion for learning and computing can be seen through my initiative to learn multiple coding languages despite my high-school not providing any computer programming courses. <br>
					In the past two years, I have managed to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Swift (XCode) by applying to programs, such as Kode With Klossy, InsideSherpa, and Coursera. The former program has especially strengthened my love for leading collaborative projects and my advocacy for more women in STEM. </p>
